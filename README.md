Stef.fm is an online music streaming platform which I am using as a permanent home for my late friend's amazing house music mix collection. I explain more in my [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/passion-project-digital-preservation-archaeology-steve-arnott/).

The platform is based on DaedalOS, an open source desktop environment in the browser project made by Dustin Brett. Please visit his repo and send him some love. He did some amazing work. And DaedalOS itself uses many open source projects. Too many to list and thank in the detail they deserve. All I can say is thank you all for your skill and generosity.

### DaedalOS - Desktop environment in the browser ðŸ‘Œ

Stef.fm is based on Based on Dustin Brett's DaedalOS - a desktop environment in the browser. An amazing recreation of a typical PC desktop experience. It has many features which make this both impressive and pleasurable to use. I won't repeat everything here. Instead, head over to his repo and send him some love.

Dustin live-coded this over a year's worth of live streams. You can check out his channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DustinBrett). He has been really generous with his time, so a massive thank you from me and the wider community. I've learned a lot and I'm forever grateful.
